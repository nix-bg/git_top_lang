# git_top_lang
Github top languages by LOC
bash script required awk,sed,tor,sudo
The code is a bit ugly, because it's written in a hurry. This was my exam for DevOps in Docker, Inc.

**Given the Github repository api, go through each repo and provide the list of top 10 languages sorted based on total LOC across all repositories.
Github API to list all public repos is documented at https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-all-public-repositories and API to find out languages for each repo is documented at https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-languages**
